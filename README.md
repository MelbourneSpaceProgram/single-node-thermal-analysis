# single-node-thermal-analysis
A basic code for demonstrating expected temperature trends in a small cube-sat. 

Based on the publication by Casper Verteeg and David L. Cotten, for the "Preliminary Thermal Analysis of Small Satellites".
In this paper, two methods are demonstrated with the first lumping the satellite into a single mass.
The code currently in this folder is based on this particular method. However, if the user requires better accuracy then the additional method in the paper which takes into account multi-node thermal analysis would be advisable.
